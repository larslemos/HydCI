In these solution, the following assumptions where made.

i) A input line is terminated by a newline
    Ex: glob is I // New line  after user press enter

ii) A empty line is processed and taken as a end of input and program exit
    Ex: glob is I // New line  after user press enter
        //Empty Line

iii) A question ends with "?"
    Ex: How much is pish?

iv) The sentence separator for "is" comes between identifiers/keywords of a transaction
    Ex: glob "is" I

v) Inputs are case sensitive
    Ex: "pish" instead of "PISH"

vi) Roman numbers input are specified in capitals
    Ex: I,V

vii) Identifier beside the "is" keyword on CREDITS input line is computed
